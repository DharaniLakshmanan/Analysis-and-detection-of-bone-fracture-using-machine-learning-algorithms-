A person’s skeleton is built upon a framework of bones. The minerals necessary for development and growth are stored in bones, which also serve as a protective living tissue for internal organs. Bone breaks are quite prevalent these days. It’s best to get this taken care of early on so it doesn’t worsen and potentially cause issues like osteoporosis and cancer of the bones. A key problem in the detection of a bone fracture is the prompt identification of whether or not the fracture is of a minor or substantial severity. In this research, we suggest a number of machine learning techniques for identifying and categorizing fracture types, including k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, gaussian naive bayes, decision tree, and random forest, to address this problem. The most frequent types of fractures are buckle breaks, avulsion breaks, and hairline breaks. To improve medical practise, we compare the classifiers’ effectiveness as well.

Dataset from universe roboflow was collected and the dataset was updated on Aug 30, 2022. The dataset contains a variety of different fracture types. The images have been labeled with different fracture features and characteristics, such as Line, Messed up Angle, Angle,fractured and so on. This Dataset is split into Train, Test and Valid. This study was conducted using the same step-by-step approach as described below.

Step-1: Required x-ray image data is collected from universe roboflow website.
Step-2: The Approach for the study has been outlined and developed.
Step-3: Performed Image Scaling, Image Augmentation, and Pre-Processing procedures such as Grayscale conversion and Gaussian blur Image Smoothing.
Step-4: For Image Segmentation 4 types of Edge detection methods and Entropy methods were used.
Step-5: Features were extracted using VGG16
Step-6: Machine learning techniques such as k-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Ma- chine, Gaussian NB, Decision Trees,Random Forest classifier and Ensemble Learning were used.
Step-7: The final conclusion is stated.
